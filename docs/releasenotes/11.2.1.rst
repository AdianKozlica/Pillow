11.2.1
------

Reading and writing AVIF images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The release of Pillow 11.2.0 was halted prematurely, due to concern over the size of
Pillow wheels containing libavif.

Instead, Pillow 11.2.1's wheels do not contain libavif. If you wish to read and write
AVIF images, you will need to build Pillow from source with libavif 1.0.0 or later.
